			<p>My name is Aaron Smith. I am a college student from the College of Western Idaho gaining my degree in 
			Software Development. I am 18 years old, I love to learn and to take a hands on approach to understanding. Additionally, I have a passion for technological medias. 
                        I am a content creator on Youtube as well as Twitch, I have experience creating 3D models, and working with GIMP to create wonderful images.</p>

			<h2>Strengths</h2>
				<p>I am a very hands on learner. If I can get down to business and get my hands dirty, 
				   I am very quick to pick up any skill that I am trying to learn.</p> 
				<p>My passions are what keep me moving, and my passion is focused on learning. 
				   I love to learn new skills, new facts, new experiences.</p>

			<h2>Technologies</h2>
				<p>In my experience, I have learned how to use and understand many technologies. 
				   I am adept at C#, as well as having an intermediate knowledge of HTML and CSS.</p>
				<p>Outside of coding, I have a basic understanding of the Unity game engine. 
					In addition, I have extensive experience with both the Blender 3D modeling program, as well as GIMP Image Manipulation.</p>
				<p><span class="tablet">However, my main passion lies in hardware. 
					I have built multiple PC's from the ground up, rehoused a PC for my mentor, and transferred files from dead laptops into new hard drives, 
					as well as many other projects that have gained me a great understanding and knowledge of the inners of a computer.</span></p>

			<h2>Other</h2>
				<p>My previous work experience has been varied and widely covering. My first experience was with installing hardwood flooring. 
					This taught me the value of hard work and gave me experience with long hours and attention to detail.</p>
				<p>I have also had experience in in customer service. I've worked at two entertainment services totaling two years which 
					gave me experience working with people, problem solving, and applying technologies in a real work environment.</p>
				<p>Finally, I have had an apprenticeship with the IT company Mad Hatter Techs&trade; based out of Boise. 
					This work gave me my first professional work experience with computers and technology specifically.</p>
